# NMQC workshop 2022

Built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) using a modified version of the [Juice theme](https://juice.huhu.io/)

## Work on the website locally

- Clone this repository.
- Install [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/).
- Build and serve the website with:

  ```
  $ zola serve
  ```
- Open `localhost:1111` in your browser.
- Making changes to *any* of the sources will instantly reload the local
  webserver, so you can look *live* at your changes taking effect.

We are pleased to announce the **Numerical Methods in Quantum Chemistry** workshop. 

The event is a satellite meeting of the WATOC 2025 conference, and continues in the tradition of presenting the foundation and application of numerical methods in theoretical chemical physics, with an additional focus on light-matter interactions and relativistic effects.  

The workshop will take place at Humboldt University, Adlershof campus, Berlin, Germany, from June 18 to June 20, 2025.
